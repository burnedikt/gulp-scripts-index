> Input html file(s) and get a (ordered) stream of all referenced scripts which can then be used for further processing, like concatenation, minification or for testing


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev gulp-scripts-index
```

## Usage

### Simple Example

If you simply need all files that are referenced in the index.html and you don't want to use the excellent [useref](https://github.com/jonkemp/gulp-useref) for further processing it is as simple as:

```js
var gsi = require('gulp-scripts-index');

gulp.src(['index.html'])
	.pipe(gsi())
	.pipe(doSomethingElse())
	.pipe(gulp.dest('./'))
```

### Example Usage with Karma

It can be tedious to configure Karma with all required source files to run tests - in particular, when this information is already known, e.g. because all the script files are referenced in the index.html. In this case, it is quite easy to use `gulp-scripts-index` to parse the index.html and feed all required scripts to karma. For more information on running karma with gulp, please also refer to [karma-runner/gulp-karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/gulp-karma)

```js
var gsi = require('gulp-scripts-index');
// we will use the gutils to buffer all piped script files and output them as an array
var gutils = require('gulp-utils');
// obviously, we'll also need karma
var karma = require('karma.runner').server;

/**
 * Run test once and exit
 */
gulp.task('test', function (done) {
	gulp.src(['index.html'])
    .pipe(gsi({
        IE: false
    }))
    .pipe(gutil.buffer(function(err, files) {
      // files now contains a list of all references scripts in the index.html - in the right order to kick right off
      karma.start({
        configFile: __dirname + '/karma.conf.js',
        // pass in our detected script files - of course you will have to add your actual tests and / or mocks
        files: files.concat(['tests/unit/**.js', 'tests/mocks/**.js']),
        singleRun: true
      }, done);
    });
});
```

## Options

- `IE` {Boolean} - Defaults to false. Whether or not to also include scripts that are for IE only, i.e. they are surrounded by Conditional comments like so:
```html
<script src="main.js"></script>
<!--[if IE 9]>
	<script src="ie-specific.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
```

In the example above, if `IE` is set to true, the plugin will also pipe the `ie-specific.js` in addition to the `main.js`.
